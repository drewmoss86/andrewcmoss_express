This is my personal website built with Express and React

Preqs: 
`npm`     : `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
`mongodb` : `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/`

After cloning, run `npm install`

It's my first foray into the MERN stack, so it is still very much a work-in-progress. 

Please feel free to take a look and drop me a line with any comments or questions about the site.

Cheers.
